    "question": "Question 2 : What is JWT, and how does it work?",
    "answer": "For beginning developers, JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a text-based format for transmitting data across web applications. It stores information in an easy-to-access manner, both for developers and computers. It can be used as a data format by any programming language and is quickly becoming the preferred syntax for APIs, surpassing XML. Now that you understand JSON as a data text format, you may be wondering What are tokens? To put it simply, a token is a string of data that represents something else, such as an identity. In the case of authentication, a non-JWT based token is a string of characters that allow the receiver to validate the senderâ€™s identity. The important distinction here is lack of meaning within the characters themselves. JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted. A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz."

    "question": "Question 3 : What is the difference between javascript and nodeJs?",
    "answer": "1. NodeJS : NodeJS is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript runtime environment that allows the javascript to be run on the server-side. Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the browser. Nodejs comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development. 2. JavaScript : Javascript is a Scripting language. It is mostly abbreviated as JS. It can be said that Javascript is the updated version of the ECMA script. Javascript is a high-level programming language that uses the concept of Oops but it is based on prototype inheritance. "

    "question": "Question 4 : How does NodeJs handle multiple requests at the same time?",
    "answer": "Multiple clients make multiple requests to the NodeJS server. NodeJS receives these requests and places them into the EventQueue . NodeJS server has an internal component referred to as the EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. This EventLoop is single threaded."
